# Description

This program is a modified copy of [TripGenerator-extended](https://github.com/JuliaLind/TripGenerator-extended). It uses https://openrouteservice.org API for auto-generating a number of consequent routes.

The program have been modified to provide data in our preferred format for our VTeam project (https://github.com/elemoser/elsparkcyklar-app). This repo is not really structured in a way that is testable, this repo is just to show the code used for generating trips, even though our modification looks a bit sloppy.
